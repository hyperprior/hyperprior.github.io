title: nushell is something different entirely
---

i don't know what it is yet, but [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) is not just a new shell.

the closest i can think to call it is the dynamically-typed DSL/interpreter for rust.

it's what python was supposed to be for c before it became it's own behemoth.
