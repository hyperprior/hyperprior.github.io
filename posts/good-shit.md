most software sucks. and not just a little. like a whole lot. there is even a [whole project](https://suckless.org/) dedicated to making it not suck so much. Below is just a running list of tools that don't suck so much, presented in no particular order and without comment because they do what they are supposed to and do it well and there isn't much left to say.

gonna just go alphabetical.
